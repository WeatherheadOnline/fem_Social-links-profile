** Opportunities for improvement **

Everything has (a bit) too much space around it! Try removing the 4px border around text elements.
- implemented 4/29 8:30p

Everything STILL has too much vertical space around it. Revisit.
- added margin:0 to elements that prev had margin:4px 4/30 9:30a

Buttons' border-radius is a bit too small
- changed from 0.6rem to 0.8rem 4/30 9:30a


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Starting by adding to .css from design file: font; color variables; spacing variables; text preset classes.

- Looked at design file and visually separated it into sections/groups. Added html containers with class tags designed for re-use on additional user profile cards.

- Added basic css for each section / text: color, background-color. Adde text-preset classes to html.

- A concern I have is that specific font weights were listed in style-guide.md, but were not listed in the Figma file. I used the "bold" and "normal" font weights listed in Figma and they look about right.

- The vertical spacing didn't match the design file when I used the same gap sizes, because the design file has a small vertical margin on all text elements. I added a small vertical margin to each of my text elements to try to match.

- To achieve vertical spacing, all elements got `margin: 0`, and were grouped into flexboxes, using the `gap` property to set vertical spacing.

- Had some trouble getting link text to be vertically centered; changed from <p> to <button> and that fixed the problem.

- Added styles for mobile first

- A stumbling block: on narrower mobile screens (360px), the bio text was wrapping. Added a media query to reduce font sizes on screens under 375px wide.

- Tablets: added a media query with a breakpoint matching the narrowest tablet screen listed in Chrome dev tools

- While writing up my submission, I realized that to make the text smaller on narrower phones, I could use what I learned in the previous challenge ("blog post preview card") to make it happen without using a media query.
